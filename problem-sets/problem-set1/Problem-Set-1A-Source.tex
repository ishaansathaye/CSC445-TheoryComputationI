\section{Instructions for Submission}
The \textbf{regular deadline} for this problem set is \textbf{Thursday, October 3, at 11:59pm.} The \textbf{late deadline} for this problem set is \textbf{Friday, October 4, at 11:59pm.} Please upload a PDF or image of your work to Canvas.

\section{How to solve/use this problem set}
The required questions are designed to help you develop and sharpen the problem-solving tools from class. The practice questions are intended to help you gain more practice with the building blocks from lecture. 
\\\\
Some questions are graded on effort. These require a credible, reasonable attempt for credit. Any such attempt will receive full credit. Other questions are graded on correctness.
\textbf{Questions that are graded on correctness are indicated as such in bold.}

\section{Required Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(Graded on correctness) (25 points)} Given a bit string (a string of 1's and 0's) $w$, the \emph{parity} of $w$ is defined to be 1 if $w$ has an odd number of 1's, and 0 if $w$ has an even number of 1's. Give a recursive definition for the parity of a bit string $w$, with $\varepsilon$ (the empty string) as the base case. (See the lecture notes on string length for inspiration.)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Base case: $\varepsilon$ has parity 0
        \item Inductive step: If $w$ has parity $p$, then $w0$ has parity $p$, and $w1$ has parity $1-p$.
        \item This definition is recursive because it refers to the parity of $w$ in the inductive step.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Give a recursive definition for each of the following languages:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item \textbf{(Graded on effort) (10 points)} The set of all strings of parentheses over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{(, )\}$ that are balanced.
            \begin{solution}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Base case: ( $\in L$, ) $\in L$, $\varepsilon \in L$
                    
                \end{itemize}
		\end{solution}
        \item \textbf{(Graded on effort) (15 points)} The set of all bit strings over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$ \textbf{not} containing the string $11$.
 		\begin{solution}
	      \begin{itemize}
            \item Base case: $\varepsilon \in L$, 0 $\in L$, 1 $\in L$
            \item Inductive step: If $w \in L$, then $w0 \in L$, $w1 \in L$, $w00 \in L$, $w01 \in L$, $w10 \in L$
          \end{itemize}
		\end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Give a mathematical set-builder definition for each of the following languages. Set-builder notation means, for example, an answer such as
    $$L = \{a^{3k} \mid k \geq 0\}$$
    or $$L = \{(aaa)^k \mid k \geq 0\}.$$
    \textbf{Do not use a description in words.} 
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item \textbf{(Graded on effort) (10 points)} The set of all strings over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a\}$ whose length is equal to a multiple of 3 plus a multiple of 5.
	      \begin{solution}
	      $$L = \{a^{3k + 5l} \mid k, l \geq 0\}$$
		\end{solution}
        \item \textbf{(Graded on correctness) (15 points)} The set of all strings over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ with exactly twice as many $b$'s as $a$'s, and with no occurrences of the substring $ba$.        
	      \begin{solution}
	      $$L = \{a^k b^{2k} \mid k \geq 0\}$$
		\end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Prove the following languages are regular by providing a DFA that recognizes each:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item \textbf{(Graded on effort) (10 points)} $$L_1 = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \textnormal{ does not contain the substring }00 \}$$
    where $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}.$ 
	      \begin{solution}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt, node distance=2cm, on grid, auto]

                \node[state, initial] (q0)   {$q_0$};
                \node[state, right of=q0] (q1)   {$q_1$};
                \node[state, accepting, right of=q1] (q2)   {$q_2$};
             
                \path[->]
                (q0) edge [bend left] node {0} (q1)
                     edge [loop above] node {1} ()
             
                (q1) edge [bend left] node {1} (q2)
                     
                (q2) edge [bend left] node {0} (q1)
                     edge [loop above] node {1} ();
             
             \end{tikzpicture}
		\end{solution}
        \item \textbf{(Graded on correctness)(15 points)} $$L_2 = \{w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \textnormal { contains at least two 0's and does not contain the substring }00\}$$
        where $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}.$ 
    
        Note that $L_2 \subseteq L_1$ i.e. $L_2$ is a subset of $L_1$. 
	      \begin{solution}
            \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt, node distance=2cm, on grid, auto]

                \node[state, initial] (q0)   {$q_0$};  % Initial state, no '0's seen
                \node[state, right of=q0] (q1)   {$q_1$};  % One '0' has been seen
                \node[state, accepting, right of=q1] (q2)   {$q_2$};  % Two '0's seen
             
                \path[->]
                (q0) edge [loop above] node {1} ()  % Self-loop on '1' at q0
                     edge [bend left] node {0} (q1) % Transition from q0 to q1 on '0'
             
                (q1) edge [loop above] node {1} ()  % Self-loop on '1' at q1
                     edge [bend left] node {0} (q2)  % Transition from q1 to q2 on second '0'
                     
                (q2) edge [bend left] node {1} (q1);  % Transition from q2 to q1 on '1'
             
             \end{tikzpicture}
